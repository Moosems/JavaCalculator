# JavaCalculator

A very simple calculator I wrote to brush up my Java. Has multiple files, a shell script to run it (`chmod +x ./runcalc.sh; ./runcalc.sh`), a nice directory structure, a file saving system, and I thought it looked nice. Not much to look at though, feel free to browse around! Best place to start is main, then Calculator, then HistoryManager, and then CustomTuple.
